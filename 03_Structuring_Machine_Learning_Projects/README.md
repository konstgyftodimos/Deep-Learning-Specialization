## Objectives
  - Understand why Machine Learning strategy is important
  - Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects
  - Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset
  - Understand how to define human-level performance
  - Use human-level perform to define your key priorities in ML projects
  - Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset
  - Understand what multi-task learning and transfer learning are
  - Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets
